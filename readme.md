# Start

A simple set of starter slides for presentations.

So far, I haven't written any of this code, only tweaked the design to suit my needs.

All code by [Aaron Jorbin](http://aaron.jorb.in/), using his [WordCamp Chicago 2014 presentation](https://github.com/aaronjorbin/wcchi2014) as a starting point. Thanks, Jorbin!
